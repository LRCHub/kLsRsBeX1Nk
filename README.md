```lrc
[00:30.59] An universe alive with sound
[00:36.49] A billion voices, a billion stars
[00:42.35] An ancient song long forgotten
[00:47.05] Ringing out across eternity
[01:00.55] 
[00:52.14] Longing to find a sense of freedom
[00:57.85] We ran like crazy from the start
[01:03.05] Perhaps we were bold to love
[01:07.09] Never saw the pain we caused
[01:21.09] 
[01:15.84] Some may say we're being weak
[01:19.82] To fantasize and dream of what the future could be
[01:25.37] We've always had our hope
[01:28.53] To change this troubled world
[01:31.03] And each step on the way
[01:34.45] We've laid the building blocks for tomorrow
[01:55.95] 
[01:43.76] We cross paths in this universe
[01:49.38] And it doesn't have to mean a thing
[01:53.99] Let me know you, let me reach out to you
[02:00.88] You're my everything
[02:10.88] 
[02:05.12] Another star burns to its core
[02:10.83] And following its orbit draws a storybook
[02:16.58] The story shines upon someone far away from here
[02:25.19] Have no fear, oh, let us meet again
[02:31.61] Somewhere far beyond the stars
[02:46.61] 
[03:04.20] Plenty of time has flown, we kept on going
[03:09.26] Seems we have traveled further than we knew
[03:14.13] Everyone we've passed by is a part of our journey
[03:20.16] Right now, I can hear their voices too
[03:27.12] It's true
[03:31.62] 
[03:31.06] We cross paths in this universe
[03:36.65] And it doesn't have to mean a thing
[03:41.69] Let me know you, let me reach out to you
[03:47.98] You're my everything
[03:57.98] 
[03:52.16] We're mere human souls
[03:56.37] And someday, we'll vanish and fade into the ever glow of time
[04:04.07] So let us live for now, let us sing out loud and clear
[04:12.33] Have no fear, oh, we will meet again
[04:18.82] Somewhere far beyond the stars
[04:33.82] 
[04:27.95] You know it all
[04:29.25] You've been my one and only love
[04:33.58] Beyond the stars
